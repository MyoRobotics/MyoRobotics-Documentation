Step 5: Mount the cable fixation pin
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _D3.4_image102:
.. figure:: images/image102.jpg
   :align: center

   Mount the cable fixation pin

   - (if needed) adjust the diameter of the mounting holes for pin (hinge pin 45x6 mm)
   - Mount the pin
   - Secure the pin on both sides with the lock washers
   - Clip on it the cable centring clip or glue in the pin
   - Note: Bearings should **not** be in the under joint fork at this time

.. _D3.4_image105:
.. figure:: images/image105.jpg
   :align: center

   Mount joint axle side.

   Mount on one side of the joint axle:
   - one of the large circlips (DIN 471 - 9 x 1)
   - one ball bearing
   - one of the small circlips (DIN 471 -6 x 0.7)


.. _D3.4_image106:
.. figure:: images/image106.jpg
   :align: center

   Insert the joint axle through the upper and under joint forks.
   Mount the other large circlip on the other side of the joint axle




Step 8: Assemble the joint axle (part 2)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _D3.4_image107:
.. figure:: images/image107.jpg
   :align: center

   Mount the other ball bearing. Mount the other small circlip. Glue the sensor magnet (use only a small drop of glue!).
   Note: the magnet can also be glued before mounting the joint axle.

.. _D3.4_image109:
.. figure:: images/image109.png
    :align: center

•	Assemble the sensor and SIM boards and the circular space in the larger side cover (glue the boards to the cover)
• Check that the red, blue and green cables are facing upwards and the other red cables are behind
•	Screw the side covers on the under joint fork

Optional Step 10: Solder the cables on one of the SB connection boards
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**This step can be skipped if now SB connection boards are to be used.**
