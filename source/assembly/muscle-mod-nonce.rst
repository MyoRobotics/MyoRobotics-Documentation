Step 1: Mount the plain bearings into the housing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image138:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image138.png
    :align: center

Put the **plain bearing (1)** and the **clip plain bearings (2)** into the housing.

Put the two **M2** **inserts (3)** in the holes of the housing.

Step 2: Assemble the pulley yoke and the spring guide shaft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image139:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image139.png
    :align: center

Put screw glue into the screw thread of the **pulley yoke** **(1)** and connect it with the **threaded rod (2).**

Stick the **magnetic strip (3)** in the longitudinal groove in the **spring guide shaft (4)**. The magnetic strip should be as near as possible to the pulley yoke as you can see in the example.

Slide the **washer (5)** down the threaded rod to the pulley yoke.

Slide the pulley yoke with the threaded rod from the right through the **clip plain bearings (6)** and put it in position.

Slide the spring guide shaft from the left through the clip plain bearings so that the threaded rod passes in its middle. Fix the rod on the shaft with the **nut and washer (7)**.

Step 3: Mount the spring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image140:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image140.png
    :align: center

Slide first the **spring (1)** then the **spacer sleeve (2)** from the left over the **spring guide shaft (4)** axle.

Use the **washer (3)** to push the spacer sleeve until it starts to preload the spring.

Then fix in place with the **wing nut (5)**.

Step 4: Assemble the cross-guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image141:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image141.png
    :align: center

Insert the **plain bearings (1)** into the **guide-roller (2)** and insert the **cylindrical pin (3)**.

Insert this assembly into the **cross-guide (4)**.

Mount the **cross-guide (4)** into the housing.

Then screw in the two **screws (5)** to hold it in place.

Step 5: Assemble the cover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image142:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image142.png
    :align: center

Press the three **M3 inserts (1)** into the **cover (2)**.

Insert the **plain bearings (3)** in the cover and place the printed **pulley (4**) between the plain bearings.

Fix the printed pulley to the cover by inserting the **cylindrical pin (5)** through both the pulley and the plain bearing. The pin must be pressed in the pulley.

Step 6: Mount the cover and the pulleys on the housing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image143:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image143.png
    :align: center

Insert the **screws (2) and (3)** from the back of the housing in holes (a), (b) and (c). One **black screw (3)** must be in hole (a).

The other **black screw (3)** goes in hole (c) as an axle for one of the **bearings (1)** and other black screw in hole (a) acts as another axle for the other **bearing (1)**.

Mount the **cover (4)** on the housing and tighten all screws. Make sure that the brass pulley can still rotate freely.

Step 7: Mount the reel on the motor shaft
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image145:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image144.png
    :align: center

Put screw glue on the **setscrew (2)**.

Mount the **reel (1)** using the setscrew on the shaft of the **motor (3)**.

Step 8: Mount the motor and the motor driver board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image146:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image145.png
    :align: center

Use the three **screws (1)** to mount the motor to the housing.

Connect the motor to the **motor driver board** **(2)**.

Mount the board with the **screws** **(3)** to the housing.

Step 9: Connect to the dispacement sensor to the Motor board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _D3.4_image144:
.. figure:: ../designPrimitives/images/image146.png
    :align: center

The **motor board (3)** should already be attached by the screws in previous step.

Insert the DS (distribution Board pins) on **wire (2)** into the **distribution Board (1)**.

Then the MD (Motor Driver board pins) on **wire (2)** into the motor Board.

Then place the **distribution board (1)** and **wedge (4)** into the slot on top of the housing unit in the photo on the right.

The side of the distribution board you can see in the photo should be in the inside of the housing unit as close to the magnet inside.
