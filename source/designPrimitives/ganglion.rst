MYO-Ganglion
=============

Type1: ECU with FlexRay bus
----------------------------

The MYO-Ganglia are main control and signal processing units,
distributed along the robots links. They are based on the TMS570LS20216,
a 32-bit ﬂoating point digital signal processor from Texas Instruments.
Together with the appropriate motor drivers, a MYO-Ganglion is able to
control up to four actuators. Fully transparent access to motor and
sensor data from MYODE is possible through the integrated 10Mbit/s
FlexRay interface, using a ’FlexRay typical’ 1ms control loop.
